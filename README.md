# Developing a mental model for how GPTs work

## Chapter 1 - Traditonal Software vs Machine Learning
- Starting with the basics

:books: In traditional software, the rules are explicitly programmed by humans. In machine learning, the model learns patterns from data.
- A Machine Learning Model is a mathematical function that maps inputs to outputs based on patterns learned from training data into model parameters
- For instance below is the mathematical function for early GPT models from 2019
